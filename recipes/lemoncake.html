        <li>1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Fine Sea Salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 Cups White Sugar</li>

        <li>16 tbls Unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 Eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li> 10 tbls Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
        <li> 6 ounces Cream Cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups Powdered Sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Whole Milk</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and coat parchment with cooking spray. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, rub white sugar and lemon zest together with your hands until well combined (sugar will start to turn yellow). </li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat 10 tablespoons butter and the lemon zest mixture at medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing at medium speed and scraping bowl well after each addition. </li>
        <li>Mix in about one-third of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in 1/3 cup sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in another one-third of flour mixture, then mix in 3 tablespoons lemon juice and remaining 1/3 cup sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in remaining one-third of flour mixture until incorporated and batter is smooth. </li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Bake until cake springs back lightly when touched in center, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>For frosting, put cream cheese and remaining 6 tablespoons butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (bowl should be clean and dry). Beat at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually mix in 3/4 cup powdered sugar at medium speed until incorporated. </li>
        <li>With mixer running at medium speed, add whipping cream, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt until fully incorporated. </li>
        <li>When cake is cool, run a small offset spatula around outside edge and invert onto a cutting board. Spread frosting evenly over top of cake. Loosely cover cake with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Use a long sharp knife to cut cake into 12 even rectangles. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; put a wire rack on baking sheet and arrange cake pieces on rack. </li>
        <li>For glaze, whisk together milk, vanilla, and remaining 3 cups powdered sugar and 5 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl until a drizzly glaze forms. </li>
        <li>Spoon glaze evenly over cake pieces, using offset spatula to spread evenly and allowing excess to drip off sides. </li>
        <li>Gently slide offset spatula under each cake piece to transfer to an airtight storage container. Chill until ready to serve (or up to 4 days). </li>
    </ol>
